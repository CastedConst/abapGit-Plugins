# abapGit-Plugins
This repository contains plugins for ABAPGit to support other objecttypes.
Most prominently, it contains a generic implementation wrapping SAPLink-Plugins.

# ABAPGit-SAPLink-Bridge
ABAPGit allows easy syncing of Git-Repositories with ABAP packages. 
However, the support for oject types is not yet as wide as the object-support by SAPLink.
Thus,  an adapter which wraps SAPLink-Plugins in order to use them with ABAPGit is included.
Since SAPLink has a more restrictive license compared to ABAPGit, you have to download the
SAPLink-Bridge in [my SAPLink Plug-ins](https://github.com/mrsimpson/SAPLink-Plugins)
