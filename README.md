# abapGit-Plugins
This repository contains plugins for abapGit to support other objecttypes. Most prominently, it contains a generic implementation wrapping SAPLink-Plugins.

# abapGit-SAPLink-Bridge
abapGit allows easy syncing of Git-Repositories with ABAP packages.

However, the support for oject types is not yet as wide as the object-support by SAPLink. Thus, there is an adapter which wraps SAPLink-Plugins in order to use them with abapGit.

Since SAPLink has a more restrictive license compared to abapGit, you have to download the SAPLink-Bridge from [SAPLink Plug-ins](https://github.com/mrsimpson/SAPLink-Plugins). Check the prerequisites before you install!
